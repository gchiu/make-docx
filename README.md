# make-docx

[Make-doc](http://www.rebol.com/article/0014.html) was Carl Sassenrath's attempt to generate documentation (in html) from a plain text specification.  Prior to this most of his documentation was done in MS Word, but curiously docx was never a target for make-doc.

So, this is a test project to see if a markup language like Make-doc can target medical letters.
